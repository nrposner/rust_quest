# rust_quest
An incremental, gamified introduction to Rust and computer science fundamentals.

Welcome! Whether you're coming from the Rust NYC Meetup or you found this repo by other channels, we're glad to have you here! Check out the `guides` module for information on the project's vision and how you can contribute.

(Note: It turns out that another project named Rust Quest already exists, and also has the goal of teaching Rust to newcomers. I believe our ambitions with this project are sufficiently different that we will continue. We'll have to think about changing the name at some point, though!)
